# Package `vame`


`vame` makes it simpler to define and make use of metadata pertaining
to one more variables (e.g. a tabular dataset). It implements the
`VariableMetadata` class, which contains the metadata. The various metadata
are accessed using slot functions such as `vm@var_description_get`.

The `VariableMetadata` class is intended for storing metadata for which there
is "one right way". For instance, a variable has one correct description in
text. This philosophy excludes tasks such as creating a manual for a dataset,
which can take many forms.

See the help page `?vame::VariableMetadata` for more information. In
particular see the examples.
