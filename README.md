# Package `vame`


`vame` makes it simpler to define and make use of metadata pertaining
to one more variables (e.g. a tabular dataset). It implements the
`VariableMetadata` class, which contains the metadata. The various metadata
are accessed using slot functions such as `vm@var_description_get`.

The `VariableMetadata` class is intended for storing metadata for which there
is "one right way". For instance, a variable has one correct description in
text. This philosophy excludes tasks such as creating a manual for a dataset,
which can take many forms.

See the help page `?vame::VariableMetadata` for more information. In
particular see the examples.

## TODO

### Priority: high

#### Type: feat

`vm@vame_category_space_dt`:

`vm@var_set_make` can be used in place of `vm@var_set_value_space_eval`
(or maybe `vm@var_set_value_space_eval` can call `vm@var_set_make`)
in the case of categorical variables when
multiple columns are requested AND the necessary data is available from
other value spaces. Currently in v0.3.0.16 it is necessary to have ALL
dependent variables in one `value_space` to show the dependency in the
output of at least `vm@vame_category_space_dt`. The downside is the
potential slowdown.

Maybe there needs to be a smart system, or user-input-based system, of
knowing which variable sets depend on what other variable sets. For instance
the user can include column `var_set_dt$dep_id_set`.
### Priority: low

#### Type: feat

`vm@var_set_value_space_sample`:

The issue of dependent variables
appears in both `sampler` and `maker` objects. It could be argued that
they should be required to have the same set of dependent variables. This
would mean improving the corresponding assertion functions. Alternatively,
a new column `var_set_dt$dep_var_nm_set` or even `var_set_dt$dep_id_set`
could be implemented --- but currently `sampler` objects can also sample
independently, so implmenting e.g. `var_set_dt$dep_id_set` would require
that independent samplers can still work. Currently in 0.3.0.15 using
`dep_var_nm_set` in `sampler` causes `data` to be asserted to contain
such variables. Maybe an independent `sampler` would need to be marked
in a special way so that the `data` assertion is not performed.
